        There once was a mouse who liked his country house until his cousin came for a visit.
      </p>
      <p>
        "In the city where I live," his cousin said, "we dine on cheese and fish and bread. 
        Each night my dinner is brought to me. I eat whatever I choose. 
        While you, country cousin, work your paws to the bone for humble crumbs in this humble home. 
        I'm used to finery. To each his own, I see!"
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon hearing this, the country mouse looked again at his plain brown house. 
        Suddenly he wasn't satisfied anymore. 
        "Why should I hunt and scrape for food to store?" he said. 
        "Cousin, I'm coming to the city with you!"
      </p>
      <p>
        Off they went into the fine town house of the plump and prosperous city mouse.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Shhh! The people are in the parlor," the city mouse said. "Let's sneak into the kitchen for some cheese and bread."
      </p>
      <p>
        The city mouse gave his wide-eyed country cousin a grand tour of the leftover food on the table. 
        "It's the easy life," the city mouse said, and he smiled as he bit into a piece of bread.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just as they were both about to bite into a chunk of cheddar cheese, in came the CAT!
      </p>
      <p>
        "Run! Run!" said the city mouse. "The cat's in the house!"
      </p>
      <p>
        As the country mouse scampered for his life out of the window, he said, "Cousin, I'm going back to the country! 
        You never told me that a CAT lives here! Thank you, but I'll take my humble crumbs in comfort over all of your finery with fear!"
      </p>
